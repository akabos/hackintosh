## Installation notes

* Bluetooth dongle worked in the installer. I managed to pair it with my Magic Keyboard and Trackpad. Right after the 
  first boot, it suddenly stopped working, so I stuck at region selection. Which lead me to the next point.
* USB keyboard and mouse have to be connected to USB 2 ports. USB 3 didn't work in the installer. Ports located close to
  PS/2 worked well.
